Solution for Assignment 6.

General Structure (some generated by django):

    assignment6/
        main dir, defines other routes

    id_selector/
        display input form for user_id

    id_selector/index.html
        input form

    recommender/
        displays the recommendations

    recommender/rec_index.html
        the recommendations as a table

    recommender/recommender.py
        recommendation logic

    recommender/recommender_helper.py
        adapter for html output


Notes:

    the movie dataset assets:
        credits.csv and movies_metadata.csv need to be placed in recommender/

    movie posters:
        there are links to movie posters in the metadata, however it appears that a lot of them
        are broken and do not work anymore. we were not able to fix this.
        thus, posters are only displayed for roughly 10% of movies.
