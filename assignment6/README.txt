Notes:

    movielens assets:
        due to the large filesize of credits.csv (and movie_metadata.csv),
        we compressed both files as pandas.read_csv() supports automatic decompression

    movie posters:
        there are links to movie posters in the metadata, however it appears that a lot of them
        are broken and do not work anymore. we were not able to fix this.
        thus, posters are only displayed for roughly 10% of movies.
